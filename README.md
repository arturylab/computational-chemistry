# Computational Chemistry Projects 🔬💻

Welcome to my **Computational Chemistry** repository! Here, I showcase my personal projects related to my PhD research in **Nanotechnology**. This repository contains studies and tools related to atomic clusters, semi-empirical calculations, first-principles methods, and Density Functional Theory (DFT).

## Purpose 🎯
The purpose of this repository is to explore and develop computational methods for studying **nanotechnology**, **atomic clusters**, and **molecular systems**. By leveraging advanced computational chemistry techniques, the goal is to better understand material properties, molecular behavior, and their potential applications in various scientific and technological fields.

## Key Areas of Focus 🧠
- **Nanotechnology** 🌱: Exploring the application of nanoscience in material science, electronics, and biotechnology.
- **Atomic Clusters** 🔬: Investigating the structure, stability, and reactivity of clusters at the atomic scale.
- **Semi-Empirical Calculations, First Principles, and DFT** 🧮: Using computational methods to solve quantum mechanical problems for molecular and material systems.
- **Tools and Utilities** 🛠️: Developing custom tools and utilities to assist with computational experiments, data analysis and Quantum Chemistry Software: ORCA, Gaussian, etc.
